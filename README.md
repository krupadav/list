# list:Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage. A list is a data structure in Python that is a mutable, or changeable, ordered sequence of elements. Each element or value that is inside of a list is called an item. Just as strings are defined as characters between quotes, lists are defined by having values between square brackets [ ].Each item is comma seperated, if we do not give coma then we will have syntax error. Lists are great to use when you want to work with many related values. They enable you to keep data together that belongs together, condense your code, and perform the same methods and operations on multiple values at once.
Background data structure of list is array, so it supports indexing and slicing as well.
As we have said list is mutable that implies we can change(replace), add or remove in already creatwd list. The changes will be saved in the list that implies that the id of the list after chnges will not change.
Order sequence implies that if we add new element to existing list it will not disturb the list and by default will be added at the end and hence preserves the sequence.
Duplicate values are allowed, as here each item will have an index. Also it accecpt homogeneous(same type) or heterogeneous data(different type), we can also add a list within the list which is known as nested list.
